It's that time of year again! (Man, I really need to blog more.)

## Books
I managed to get to _most_ of the books I wanted to read in 2017 (see below for the ones I'm rolling into next year). Here are a few extras I read:

#### [Hillbilly Elegy](#)
**J.D. Vance**
This book came on my radar not long after the 2016 presidential election. While I did gain some valuable insights into Appalachia and TK through the lens of Vance's personal experiences, I felt like some of the explanations he provides (basically that hillbillies—his term—have brought their misfortune on themselves through "learned helplessness" and a cultural opposition to education) are unnuanced and overly simplistic.

#### [The Cuckoo's Egg](#)
**Cliff Stoll**
I found this one after reading the [Wikipedia article about Markus Hess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Hess). It was a fascinating look into the state of computer security and the Internet in the 1980s, and the writing and pacing made for a really good detective story.

#### [What Hedge Funds Really Do](#)
**Philip J. Romero and Tucker Balch**
This book was required reading for [Machine Learning for Trading](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7646-machine-learning-trading) (also part of my masters degree program at Georgia Tech). TK.

#### [A Random Walk Down Wall Street](#)
**Burton G. Malkiel**
This is sort of a classic in terms of literature on investing in the stock market, so TK.

#### [Liar's Poker](#)
**Michael Lewis**
This one has actually been on my "to-read" list since the 2008 financial crisis. TK.

#### [The Big Short](#)
**Michael Lewis**
I really enjoyed _Liar's Poker_, so I figured I'd give this a shot as well. TK.

#### [The Manager's Path](#)
**Camille Fournier**
I've been meaning to read this since I first heard Camille was working on it! Camille was my CTO when I worked at Rent the Runway, and TK.

#### [The First 90 Days](#)
**Michael D. Watkins**
I moved from Hulu to Fox Networks Group in July, and TK.

#### [Practical Machine Learning](#)
**Ted Dunning and Ellen Friedman**
This is really more of a long blog post/tutorial on [PredictionIO's universal recommender](http://actionml.com/docs/ur) and its correlated cross-occurrenc algorithm for making recommendations. TK.

Here are the books I want to read in 2018, starting with the five books I've rolled over from 2017.

#### [Type-Driven Development with Idris](https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris)
**Edwin Brady**
I did some reading and work on [Idris](http://www.idris-lang.org/) in 2016, so I'm really excited to read Edwin's book this year.

#### [Mindset: The New Psychology of Success](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0345472322)
**Carol S. Dweck**
I mentioned this book in [a talk](https://speakerdeck.com/ericqweinstein/booting-up-hiring-and-growing-boot-camp-graduates) I gave at RailsConf in May of 2016. I read a couple of Dweck's papers while preparing for that talk, and I think there's a tremendous amount I can learn from _Mindset_ for my growth as both an individual contributor and as an engineering leader.

#### [First, Break All the Rules](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002IU6LR6)
**Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman**
I've heard good things about this book at each of the last four places I've worked, so it's probably high time I read it.

#### [A Billion Voices: China's Search for a Common Language](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0734399596)
**David Moser**
This book was recommended by my Mandarin teacher, and I think it'll be really interesting to see how modern Mandarin arose from a highly fragmented set of spoken languages and traditions.

#### [The Three-Body Problem](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0765382032)
**Cixin Liu**
This is the only novel on my reading list, but it's been recommended to me by three completely separate groups of friends, so I'm expecting to really enjoy it. (It's not that I don't enjoy reading novels—I do—but they've been crowded out by my interests in poetry, philosophy, and computation over the past handful of years.)

#### [The Practice of Programming](https://www.amazon.com/dp/020161586X)
**Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike**
TK.

#### [English Grammar for Students of German](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0934034389)
**Cecile Zorach _et al._**
TK.

#### [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0131177052)
**Michael Feathers**
TK.

#### [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015VACHOK)
**Andrew S. Grove**
TK.

#### [Eichmann in Jerusalem](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001RHOJSE)
**Hannah Arendt**
TK.

#### [What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MNMHBA0)
**Brendan Moynihan**
TK.

#### [Consciousness Explained](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N807LD2)
**Daniel Dennett**
TK.
