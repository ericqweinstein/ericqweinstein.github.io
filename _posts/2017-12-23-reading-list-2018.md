It's that time of year again! (Man, I really need to blog more.)

## Books
I managed to get to _most_ of the books I wanted to read in 2017 (see below for the ones I'm rolling into next year). Here are a few extras I read:

#### [Hillbilly Elegy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0166ISAS8)
**J.D. Vance**
This book came on my radar not long after the 2016 presidential election. While I did gain some valuable insights into Appalachia through the lens of Vance's personal experiences, I felt like some of the explanations he provides (basically that hillbillies—his term—have brought their misfortune on themselves through "learned helplessness" and a cultural opposition to education) are unnuanced and overly simplistic.

#### [The Cuckoo's Egg](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0083DJXCM)
**Cliff Stoll**
I found this one after reading the [Wikipedia article about Markus Hess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Hess). It was a fascinating look into the state of computer security and the Internet in the 1980s, and the writing and pacing made for a really good detective story.

#### [What Hedge Funds Really Do](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MYFT0TQ)
**Philip J. Romero and Tucker Balch**
This book was required reading for [Machine Learning for Trading](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7646-machine-learning-trading) (also part of my masters degree program at Georgia Tech). It's a pretty quick read (one afternoon/sitting) and provided me a decent overview of hedge funds' history, how they work, and the theory behind risk mitigation. (Spoiler: the only decent way to make money with hedge funds is to run them.)

#### [A Random Walk Down Wall Street](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QH9NTSI)
**Burton G. Malkiel**
This is sort of a classic in terms of literature on investing in the stock market, so I figured I'd pick it up. It's surprisingly long—a little over 450 pages—and I got tired about three quarters of the way through. The general sentiment is to invest in a diverse portfolio early in your career and invest as much as you can over time, adjusting your portfolio to become more conservative as you age. Nothing really groundbreaking, but his asides, anecdotes, and worked examples are worth slogging through the more repetitious parts.

#### [Liar's Poker](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003E20ZRY)
**Michael Lewis**
This one has actually been on my "to-read" list since the 2008 financial crisis. I'd heard a lot about the culture of 1980s Wall Street, and it sounds like most of it was true: unchecked greed, no-neck traders gleefully ripping off anyone they could, little (if any) true oversight. This was a good mix of horrifying and entertaining, but the more I think about it, the more I find it the former than the latter. (I doubt much, if anything, has really changed in the banking industry over the intervening years. Maybe there's less cocaine now.)

#### [The Big Short](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003LSTK8G)
**Michael Lewis**
I really enjoyed _Liar's Poker_, so I figured I'd give this a shot as well. This book focuses on the forces that led to the 2008 financial crisis (specifically, the proliferation of credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations). I highly recommend this book (I haven't seen the film, but I've heard it's good); however, if you just want the details of the crisis without the story elements, [this video](http://crisisofcredit.com/) is a good TL;DR.

#### [The Manager's Path](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491973897)
**Camille Fournier**
I'd been meaning to read this since I first heard Camille (who was my CTO when I worked at Rent the Runway), and I was not disappointed. I highly, highly recommend this book to managers in all industries, but especially those in tech (I found the chapters on managing more than one team and managing managers particularly relevant).

#### [The First 90 Days](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1422188612)
**Michael D. Watkins**
I moved from Hulu to Fox Networks Group in July, and I figured then was as good at time as any to re-read _The First 90 Days_. While I think some of the more salient points can be distilled into a blog post (which I'll plan to tackle in early 2018), I think it's still worth a full read, especially if you're joining and/or leading a new team.

#### [Practical Machine Learning](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033172.do)
**Ted Dunning and Ellen Friedman**
This is really more of a long blog post/tutorial on [PredictionIO's universal recommender](http://actionml.com/docs/ur) and its [correlated cross-occurrenc algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.3472.pdf) for making recommendations, but I still enjoyed it. It's a very quick read (only fifty or sixty pages).

Here are the books I want to read in 2018, starting with the five books I've rolled over from 2017.

#### [Type-Driven Development with Idris](https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris)
**Edwin Brady**
I did some reading and work on [Idris](http://www.idris-lang.org/) in 2016, so I'm really excited to read Edwin's book this year.

#### [Mindset: The New Psychology of Success](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0345472322)
**Carol S. Dweck**
I mentioned this book in [a talk](https://speakerdeck.com/ericqweinstein/booting-up-hiring-and-growing-boot-camp-graduates) I gave at RailsConf in May of 2016. I read a couple of Dweck's papers while preparing for that talk, and I think there's a tremendous amount I can learn from _Mindset_ for my growth as both an individual contributor and as an engineering leader.

#### [First, Break All the Rules](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002IU6LR6)
**Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman**
I've heard good things about this book at each of the last four places I've worked, so it's probably high time I read it.

#### [A Billion Voices: China's Search for a Common Language](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0734399596)
**David Moser**
This book was recommended by my Mandarin teacher, and I think it'll be really interesting to see how modern Mandarin arose from a highly fragmented set of spoken languages and traditions.

#### [The Three-Body Problem](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0765382032)
**Cixin Liu**
This is the only novel on my reading list, but it's been recommended to me by three completely separate groups of friends, so I'm expecting to really enjoy it. (It's not that I don't enjoy reading novels—I do—but they've been crowded out by my interests in poetry, philosophy, and computation over the past handful of years.)

#### [The Practice of Programming](https://www.amazon.com/dp/020161586X)
**Brian W. Kernighan and Rob Pike**
I'll ready pretty much anything by Kernighan and Pike, and I'm particularly hoping for some good insights on the tougher aspects of engineering (balancing tradeoffs, identifying the human roots of technical problems, &c).

#### [English Grammar for Students of German](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0934034389)
**Cecile Zorach _et al._**
My German has gone a bit downhill since I first started learning in high school (wer rastet, der rostet, nicht wahr?), and while my pronunciation is still pretty good and vocabulary comes back to me quickly, I don't feel I have as firm a grammatical footing as I'd like. Hopefully reading this book and practicing my spoken German helps with that!

#### [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0131177052)
**Michael Feathers**
This book has been recommended to me by too many people for me to continue not reading it.

#### [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015VACHOK)
**Andrew S. Grove**
This was recommended to me at a conference I attendeded earlier this year. Andrew Grove was employee number three at Intel and has built some really impressive teams in the course of his career, so I'm looking forward to reading his story and learning from his mistakes.

#### [Eichmann in Jerusalem](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001RHOJSE)
**Hannah Arendt**
"A report on the banality of evil" seems particularly relevant in our current political climate.

#### [What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MNMHBA0)
**Brendan Moynihan**
I mentioned looking forward to learning from Andrew Grove's mistakes in _High Output Management_, and that's doubly true for this book. Most of the narrative finance books I've read are more analyses of other people's realizations and mistakes; I'm hoping to glean something a bit more qualitative (in terms of the pyschology of investing) from this first-person account.

#### [Consciousness Explained](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N807LD2)
**Daniel Dennett**
I've been a big fan of Dennett's work since college (I focused on philosophy of physics and theory of mind), and I'm particularly interested in this book and its view of consciousness as a continuum.

## Papers
In addition to the papers I set out to read in 2017, I picked up a _ton_ more (grad school will do that to you). Omitting some PDFs that aren't strictly peer-reviewed academic papers, but were nonetheless required reading for school, they were:

#### [The Geometry of Innocent Flesh on the Bone: Return-into-libc without Function Calls (on the x86)](https://www.kapravelos.com/teaching/csc574-f16/readings/geometry.pdf)
**Hovav Shacham**
I read this paper for my introduction to information security class, and it was a good introduction to [return-to-libc attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-to-libc_attack) (I got to write my own exploit as part of my coursework!).

#### [On the Effectiveness of Address-Space Randomization](https://web.stanford.edu/~blp/papers/asrandom.pdf)
**Hovav Shacham _et al._**
Another InfoSec paper (which is true of the next several, so I'll just note when we move on from that topic). This one focused on the benefits of [address-space layout randomization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization), or ASLR, in preventing attackers from jumping to known points in memory.

#### [ASLR-Guard: Stopping Address Space Leakage for Code Reuse Attacks](#)
**Kangjie Lu _et al._**
ASLR is only effective if the address layout is truly random and no information about the randomization or ensuing layout is leaked. This paper discusses the possibility of information leakage and proposes ASLR-Guard as a measure to mitigate it (by rendering leaked pointer information useless).

#### [Code-Pointer Integrity](http://dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/cpi.pdf)
**Volodymyr Kuznetsov _et al._**
This paper covers Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) as an augmentation to tools like ALSR. By enforcing CPI, it's possible to prevent any kind of control-flow hijacking by an attacker (such as [ROP exploits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming)).

#### [Control-Flow Bending: On the Effectiveness of Control-Flow Integrity](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-carlini.pdf)
**Nicolas Carlini and Mathias Payer**
Another method of preventing control-flow hijacking, but with somewhat higher overhead than CPI.

#### [Mining Your Ps and Qs: Detection of Widespread Weak Keys in Network Devices](https://factorable.net/weakkeys12.extended.pdf)
**Nadia Heninger, Zakir Durumeric, Eric Wustrow, and J. Alex Halderman**
I found this paper _really_ fascinating. It explores RSA and DSA failures caused by malfunctioning random number generators, particularly devices that generate predictable random numbers due to insufficient entropy in the input pool during boot (see Figure 5 in the paper). As is the case with all good security papers: really interesting, _really_ scary.

#### [Q-Learning in Continuous State and Action Spaces](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~rsl/rsl_papers/99ai.kambara.pdf)
**Chris Gaskett, David Wettergreen, and Alexander Zelinsky**
Moving on from InfoSec, we now enter the realm of reinforcement learning! (I took [Reinforcement Learning](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/cs-8803-special-topics-reinforcement-learning) over the summer.) TK.

I followed some of the news about AlphaGo's victory over Lee Sedol back in March, but didn't get a chance to read the paper, so it's on my to-read list for the new year.

#### [Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Synchronization but Were Afraid to Ask](http://sigops.org/sosp/sosp13/papers/p33-david.pdf)
**Tudor David, Rachid Guerraoui, and Vasileios Trigonakis**
Synchronization is hard! Hopefully reading this paper makes it less so (for me, anyway).
