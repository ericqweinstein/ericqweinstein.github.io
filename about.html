<p>I write poems &amp; programs. My poems have appeared or are forthcoming in <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Ploughshares</em>, <em>The Yale Review</em>, and others.</p>

<p>My software is mostly on <a href="https://github.com/ericqweinstein" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I've worked at startups, enterprise organizations, a consultancy, and even <a href="http://auxplatform.com">started my own company</a>! My graduate work is in creative writing (MFA, New York University) and computer science, with a concentration in machine learning (MS, Georgia Institute of Technology). I'm currently Director of Engineering at <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com" target="_blank">ZipRecruiter</a>, where I'm helping build the world's first artificially intelligent job marketplace. I enjoy writing Clojure, Elixir, Idris, Ruby, and Swift.</p>
