<p>I write poems &amp; programs. My poems have appeared or are forthcoming in <em>AGNI</em>, <em>Alaska Quarterly Review</em>, <em>Barrow Street</em>, The <em>Believer</em>, <em>Crazyhorse</em>, <em>Gulf Coast</em>, <em>The Iowa Review</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Ploughshares</em>, <em>Shenandoah</em>, <em>The Southern Review</em>, <em>The Yale Review</em>, and others.</p>

<p>My software is mostly on <a href="https://github.com/ericqweinstein" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I'm currently an engineer/manager at <a href="https://github.com/condenast" target="_blank">Cond√© Nast</a>, where I work on site migrations to React and modern JavaScript for our 20-some-odd brands. Side projects include <a href="http://www.bodegamag.com/" target="_blank">Bodega</a> and <a href="http://www.cityshelf.com/" target="_blank">CityShelf</a>. I enjoy writing Clojure, Haskell, Ruby, and Swift.</p>
