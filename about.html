<p>I write poems &amp; programs. My poems have appeared or are forthcoming in <em>AGNI</em>, <em>Alaska Quarterly Review</em>, <em>Barrow Street</em>, The <em>Believer</em>, <em>Crazyhorse</em>, <em>Gulf Coast</em>, <em>The Iowa Review</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Ploughshares</em>, <em>Shenandoah</em>, <em>The Southern Review</em>, <em>The Yale Review</em>, and others.</p>

<p>My software is mostly on <a href="https://github.com/ericqweinstein" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I'm currently CTO of <a href="https://www.auxtoken.com" target="_blank">AUX</a>, where I'm building a team and platform to conduct auctions on the Ethereum blockchain, and recently finished my master's degree in computer science at Georgia Tech, where I specialized in machine learning. I enjoy writing Clojure, Idris, Ruby, Solidity, and Swift.</p>
