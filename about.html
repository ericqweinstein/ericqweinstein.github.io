<p>I write poems &amp; programs. My poems have appeared or are forthcoming in <em>The New Yorker</em>, <em>Ploughshares</em>, <em>The Yale Review</em>, and others.</p>

<p>My software is mostly on <a href="https://github.com/ericqweinstein" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I've worked at startups, enterprise organizations, and even <a href="http://auxplatform.com">started my own company</a>! I recently finished my master's degree in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, where I specialized in machine learning. I'm currently a consultant with <a href="http://testdouble.com" target="_blank">Test Double</a>, where I'm helping our clients building amazing software. I enjoy writing Clojure, Elixir, Idris, Ruby, and Swift.</p>
