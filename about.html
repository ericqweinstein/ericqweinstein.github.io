<p>I write poems &amp; programs. My poems have appeared or are forthcoming in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/01/30/the-view-from-atlantis" target="_blank"><em>The New Yorker</em></a>, <a href="https://www.pshares.org/authors/eric-weinstein" target="_blank"><em>Ploughshares</em></a>, <a href="https://yalereview.yale.edu/volume-101-0" target="_blank"><em>The Yale Review</em></a>, and others.</p>

<p>My software is mostly on <a href="https://github.com/ericqweinstein" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. I've worked at startups, enterprise organizations, a consultancy, and even started my own company! I've done graduate work in creative writing (<a href="https://gsas.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/gsas/academics/bulletin/cwp/mfa-creative-writing.html" target="_blank">MFA, NYU</a>) and computer science (<a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/future/masters/mscs", target="_blank">MS, Georgia Tech</a>). I'm currently Director, Engineering at <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/" target="_blank">HashiCorp</a>, leading the Infrastructure Product Group (Terraform, Packer, Vagrant, and Waypoint).</p>
